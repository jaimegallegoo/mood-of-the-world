# Mood of the World

A data science project to analyze the global emotional "mood" of music using Spotify data.

This project estimates a **Mood Index** per country and time period by combining:
- **Spotify API metadata**: Tracks and artists info (genres, popularity).
- **Public audio features**: A dataset with valence, energy, danceability, and tempo.
- **Daily Charts**: Streaming data per country to weight the impact of each song.

We compute `MoodIndex = (valence + energy) / 2`, aggregate by country/date, and visualize seasonal trends.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- A Spotify App (Client ID/Secret) for Development mode.

**Setup:**
```powershell
python -m venv venv
& ./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file with your credentials:

```
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_id
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
```

## Data Sources

The `data/` and `figures/` folders are not included in the repository due to their size, but the folder structure is preserved. Follow these instructions to obtain the required datasets:

### 1. Spotify Audio Features Dataset (Kaggle)

Download the public audio features dataset from Kaggle:

- **Source**: [Spotify Audio Features](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomigelo/spotify-audio-features) by Tomigelo
- **File**: `SpotifyAudioFeaturesApril2019.csv`
- **Location**: Place in `data/raw/`

This dataset contains audio features (valence, energy, danceability, tempo, etc.) for approximately 130,000 tracks. It is used as a fallback source for audio features due to Spotify API restrictions.

### 2. Worldwide Daily Song Ranking (Kaggle)

Download the daily streaming charts dataset:

- **Source**: [Spotify's Worldwide Daily Song Ranking](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking) by Eduardo Mucelli
- **File**: `worldwide_daily_song_ranking.csv`
- **Location**: Place in `data/raw/`

This dataset contains daily song rankings and stream counts for multiple countries, enabling the analysis of music consumption patterns across different regions.

### 3. Natural Earth Admin Boundaries (for map visualizations)

Download the country boundaries shapefile:

- **Source**: [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) - Admin 0 Countries (110m resolution)
- **Direct link**: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/
- **Files**: `ne_110m_admin_0_countries.*` (shp, dbf, prj, etc.)
- **Location**: Place in `data/external/ne_admin0/`

### 4. Spotify API Credentials

To fetch track and artist metadata, you need Spotify API credentials:

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new application
3. Note your Client ID and Client Secret
4. Add `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` as a Redirect URI
5. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your credentials (see above)

### Generated Data

The following files are generated by the processing pipeline and do not need to be downloaded:

- `data/interim/`: Metadata fetched from Spotify API, cleaned audio features
- `data/processed/`: Final mood scores per country and date, summary statistics
- `figures/`: All visualization outputs (maps, charts, comparisons)

---

## Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation

Clean the public audio features dataset (Kaggle snapshot):

```powershell
python src/load_public_data.py --input data/raw/SpotifyAudioFeaturesApril2019.csv --out data/interim/audio_features_clean.csv
```

### 2. Execution (Multi-Country)

Run the main pipeline. This script fetches charts, queries the Spotify API for metadata (handling rate limits), and merges data for 8 countries across Europe, America, Asia, and Oceania.

```powershell
python src/multi_country_run.py
```

### 3. Summarization

Aggregate KPIs (Mood Index, Match Rate, Streams) into a summary CSV:

```powershell
python src/summarize.py
```

### 4. Visualization

Generate the final figures for the report (English labels):

**Seasonal Comparison (Key Chart):**

```powershell
python src/visualize_seasonal.py
```

**World Maps (Summer/Winter):**

```powershell
python src/visualize_map.py --date 2017-08-01 --metric w_mean_streams
python src/visualize_map.py --date 2018-01-05 --metric w_mean_streams
```

**Country Rankings:**

```powershell
python src/visualize_countries.py
```

All figures are saved in the `figures/` directory.

---

## Methodology Notes

- **Hybrid Approach**: Due to Spotify API restrictions on audio-features (403 Forbidden), we fetch metadata via API but retrieve valence/energy from a public dataset using robust name matching.

- **Metrics**: The `w_mean_streams` metric weights the Mood Index by the number of streams in the daily chart, offering a more realistic representation of what people are actually listening to.
